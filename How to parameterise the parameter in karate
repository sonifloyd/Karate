Setting query-string parameters:

Given param someKey = 'hello'
And param anotherKey = someVariable
The above would result in a URL like: http://myhost/mypath?someKey=hello&anotherKey=foo. Note that the ? and & will be automatically inserted.

Multi-value params are also supported:

* param myParam = ['foo', 'bar']
For convenience, a null value will be ignored. You can also use JSON to set multiple 
query-parameters in one-line using params and this is especially useful for dynamic data-driven testing.

parameterise like this 
 And param wmsCode = '#(wmsCode)'
 
  And params {skid: #(skidNo)}
