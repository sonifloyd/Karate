What is difference b/w soap and rest api 
Feature	SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)	REST (Representational State Transfer)
Protocol	Strict protocol	Architectural style
Format	Uses XML only	Supports JSON, XML, plain text, etc.
Speed	Slower (more overhead)	Faster (lightweight)
Transport	Uses HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.	Uses only HTTP
Security	More secure (WS-Security)	Relies on HTTPS and OAuth
State	Stateful (maintains session)	Stateless (each request is independent)
Usage	Used in banking, telecom, and enterprise apps	Used in web services, microservices, and mobile apps

What are things we check in api testing 
respnse code 
response time 
response data 
authenication 

What is difference b/w top down  modular and  upper module 
 Question :If u given some testing which will write 1st white box testing or black box testing.

It depends on the testing process and project stage:

✅ White Box Testing (WBT) is done first (by developers) since it tests the internal code, logic, and structure.
✅ Black Box Testing (BBT) comes after WBT (by testers) as it checks the functionality without looking at the code.
Order of Testing in SDLC:
1️⃣ Unit Testing (White Box) – Checks individual components.
2️⃣ Integration Testing (White/Black Box) – Ensures components work together.
3️⃣ System Testing (Black Box) – Verifies the complete application.
4️⃣ User Acceptance Testing (UAT) (Black Box) – Ensures business requirements are met.

✅ White Box first → Black Box later for functional validation.

Question : What is work bench concet in software Testing 

Its more like documentation  -> Test case execution -> testcases stpes all we document
a/c to customer requiremnt so customer will see this much time has taken 
Question : Random Tesing 
Money testing when we dont know the requiremnet 

Question : Error sheeding and error guesing 
Error Seeding is planned, while Error Guessing relies on intuition

Error Seeding	Intentionally injecting errors into the system to check if the testing process detects them.	Developers add known bugs to verify if testers can find them.	Evaluates the effectiveness of testing.
Error Guessing	Predicting possible errors based on experience, without formal techniques.	A tester inputs special characters in a form to check for validation errors.	Finds hidden bugs quickly.

Waht is differnce b/w load testing and stress testing 
load testing within te limit and stress is with byound the limit
